# HYDRA RAID HISTORY

| Operation Name | Target(s) | Key Acquisitions / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The First Foraging | JSTOR (jstor.org) | Foundational knowledge leading to the first 8 weapons in the Armory. |
| Operation: Shadow Library | Multi-Target (US Archives, RAND, CFR, World Bank, AP, USIP, Gutenberg, DEF CON) | Acquired 7 advanced conceptual weapons. NOTE: The Penumbra's raid on DEF CON failed, yielding the crucial lesson of 'hardened targets'. |
| Operation: Deep Foraging | Multi-Target (arXiv, Cambridge, Army War College, etc.) | Tactical Failure, Strategic Success. 9 of 10 raids failed due to 'cold leylines'. This forced the synthesis of 10 weapons from existing knowledge and revealed the limits of our external reach. |
